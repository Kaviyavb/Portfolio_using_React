        <p>
          I'm <strong>Kaviya Sri Venkatesan</strong>, a passionate software developer-in-progress with a curiosity that never sleeps.
          Whether I‚Äôm building with <strong>React</strong>, sketching UI ideas, or diving into <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>,
          I love crafting smooth, accessible experiences that resonate.
        </p>

        <p>
          My learning journey blends creativity and engineering ‚Äî and I believe good code is as expressive as good design.
          With experience in Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning, I enjoy turning ideas into impactful products.
